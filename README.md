## Overview

### Research Objectives
1. **Analysis**: Evaluate historical trends in global land-ocean temperature indices using time series and nonlinear regression methods.
2. **Prediction**: Develop predictive models to estimate future trends in temperature indices.
3. **Insights**: Provide actionable insights into the accelerating pace of global warming and its implications.

### Key Features
- **Data Source**: NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) Global Land-Ocean Temperature Index (1880â€“2023).
- **Methods**:
  - Time Series Analysis: ARIMA modeling.
  - Nonlinear Regression: Quadratic modeling to capture nonlinear trends.
- **Results**:
  - Predictive trends of global temperature indices for the next decade.
  - Comprehensive analysis of historical data, including trends and seasonality.


## Results
- **ARIMA Model**:
  - Captured short-term fluctuations and long-term trends.
  - Predicts a gradual rise in global temperature indices over the next decade.
- **Nonlinear Regression**:
  - Highlights accelerated warming trends, with quadratic components capturing exponential growth in temperature increases.

## Key Findings
- Global temperature indices exhibit consistent upward trends, with significant acceleration post-1970s.
- Nonlinear regression reveals that temperature increases are better modeled using quadratic trends, indicating rapid climate change.
